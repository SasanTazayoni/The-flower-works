# The Flower Works

Welcome to The Flower Works README file! This has all the essential information about the florist business website.

## Introduction

The Flower Works is a renowned family-run florist specialising in exquisite floral arrangements and services. It is real business located in west London and has an online presence mainly via Instagram.

The business currently has a website; however, it could benefit from enhanced features and a more contemporary design. As a result, I have undertaken a comprehensive revamp, which you can explore [here](https://sasantazayoni.github.io/The-flower-works/).

Colour scheme:

This combination creates a visually appealing and captivating colour palette that is both vibrant and harmonious.

### Typography

* 'Playfair Display' is the font used for headings with a fallback of the font-stack 'Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif'. Playfair Display is aesthetically pleasing and easily readable. From the multiple suggestions online, this seemed like the most appropriate choice due its vintage appeal.
* 'Roboto' is the font used for the body text with a fallback of the font-stack 'Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif'. Roboto is optimised for web usage and is a popular pairing with Playfair Display. Roboto is also renowned for it versatility, visual appeal and accessibility therefore was a natural choice for the body text.

### Imagery

The images play a vital role in terms of the user experience on a florist website. They are able to captivate visitors and convey the beauty and essence of flowers in a way that words alone cannot. At the time of writing this README.md file, placeholder images are being used but they will be replaced with images supplied by the business owner for the final iteration of the website.

* The logo image is a simple but effective icon that can be reused across many other platforms representing the business brand.
* The hero image is purposely vibrant and beautiful and gives a positive association with the business.
* The image on the about page shows a view of the front of the business.
* The services images show a sample of some of the flowers offered by the business.
* The gallery has been carefully designed with images that are Photoshop-editted so that they are aligned centrally, showing the flowers clearly. This page is extremely important for customers and therefore extra effort has been put into its design so that all images are clear and of high-quality on all screen sizes.
* The modal images are each supplied in a larger size individually to retain the quality of the images.
* The contact page has a placeholder image and works correctly with the grid. This image will be replaced with a picture of the owner of the business.

### Overview

The website is thoughtfully crafted to emanate a vibrant sense of beauty. It seamlessly combines accessibility with small yet impactful features, creating a modern, artistic and elegantly simplistic design.

## Wireframes
