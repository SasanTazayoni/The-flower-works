# The Flower Works

Welcome to The Flower Works README file! This has all the essential information about the florist business website.

## Introduction

The Flower Works is a renowned family-run florist specialising in exquisite floral arrangements and services. It is real business located in west London and has an online presence mainly via Instagram.

The business currently has a website; however, it could benefit from enhanced features and a more contemporary design. As a result, I have undertaken a comprehensive revamp, which you can explore [here](https://sasantazayoni.github.io/The-flower-works/).
